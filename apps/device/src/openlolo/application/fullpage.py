"""Scroll a screen page by page on the box and join the pages into one tall image.

The caller asks once; the box flicks the content up and lets iOS scroll it with momentum,
waits for the screen to settle, captures, measures how far the content moved by matching the
overlap between consecutive frames, and stops when the content no longer moves or the page
budget is spent.
Fixed chrome (status bar, search bar, sticky tabs, tab bar) is detected per pair of frames as
the rows that stay put while the rest moves, and is excluded from matching so it appears once
in the joined image: the top from the first page, the bottom from the last.

All image work is Pillow on grayscale copies; nothing here touches the phone directly.
